## ðŸ”¹ 2. Targeting & Substitutions

### `@unit` / `[target=unit]`

Specifies who to act on:

* `@target` â†’ current target
* `@focus` â†’ focus target
* `@mouseover` â†’ unit your mouse is over
* `@player` â†’ yourself
* `@pettarget` â†’ your petâ€™s target
* `@party1` â€¦ `@party4` â†’ party members
* `@raid1` â€¦ `@raid40` â†’ raid members
* `@arena1` â€¦ `@arena5` â†’ arena enemies
* `@boss1` â€¦ `@boss4` â†’ boss units

ðŸ’¡ `@unit` is shorthand for `[target=unit]`. Both work.

---

### `% substitutions` (chat/emotes only)

* `%t` â†’ name of your target
* `%f` â†’ name of your focus
* `%m` â†’ name of your mouseover target

Example:

```
/y Focusing %t â€” kill it fast!
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Conditionals

Conditionals go inside `[ ]`. You can chain them:

* Commas (`,`) = AND logic
* Semicolons (`;`) = OR logic (priority order)

Example:

```
/cast [mod:shift,@focus,harm][] Polymorph
```

â†’ Polymorphs focus if Shift held, else casts on target.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Examples

**Mouseover heal with fallback:**

```
/cast [@mouseover,help,nodead][] Flash Heal
```

**Focus CC with modifier:**

```
/cast [mod:shift,@focus,harm,nodead][] Polymorph
```

**Mount macro (ground if no flying available):**

```
/cast [flyable] Swift Flight Form; Swift Zulian Tiger
```

**Weapon swap + ability:**

```
/equip [equipped:Shields] Staff of Domination
/equip [noequipped:Shields] Shield of Impenetrable Darkness
/cast Shield Block
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Special Notes

* You canâ€™t **condition on health/mana values** in 3.3.5 macros (protected functions).
* `[target=]` and `@` are **fully interchangeable**.
* `%t`, `%f`, `%m` only expand in **chat/emote macros**, never in `/cast`.
* Most macros can only execute **one GCD ability per press** â€” no automation beyond that.
